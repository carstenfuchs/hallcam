    Some notes:

      - Older pictures should be deleted before newer pictures.
      - Less important pictures should be deleted before more important pictures.

    For example, a picture that is unimportant but only a day old could have
    the same significance (priority for deletion) as another picture that is
    very important but now several years old.

    That is, if we put the age and the importance of a picture into a coordinate
    system, the picture with the coordinate p1 = (age: 1 day, importance: 1)
    should have the same score as a picture at coordinate p2 = (age: 8 years,
    importance: 8).

    Note that we can interpolate between p1 and p2 and that the line through
    p1 and p2 can be considered a 2-dimensional hyperplane. The distance of any
    point to that hyperplane can be taken as the score of that point.
