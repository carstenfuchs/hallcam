# HallCam

HallCam is a video monitoring solution for buildings and places.

The key idea is to equip your building with several webcams that upload their images and video clips to a webserver.

Each webcam is implemented with a Raspberry Pi with a camera module that is mounted in an indoor or outdoor weatherproof case.
One part of this project is the software that is run on the Raspberry Pis.
The software controls when and how images are taken and uploaded to the webserver.

The other part of the project is a website that allows users to see the uploaded content.
